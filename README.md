# Car_Detection
As a critical component of self-driving car projects, It would be necessary to first build a car detection system. Here is some car detection algorithms using CNN and Transfer Learning
#####NOTE##### If you have issues loading the notebook on github (as github have some backend malefunctions loading Jupyter notebook files) you can see the codes from nbviewer : https://nbviewer.org/github/A-Arhami/Car_Detection/blob/main/Car_detection_using_YOLO.ipynb
